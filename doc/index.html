<h1> s6-frontend </h1>

<h2> What is it&nbsp;? </h2>

<p>
 s6-frontend is a frontend to the s6 init system. It provides
the one-stop-shop <a href="s6.html">s6</a> command, that is used
to address every part of the init system.
</p>

<h3> Huh? </h3>

<p>
 The <em>s6 init system</em> is made of several different parts:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> The <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/">s6 process supervision suite</a>,
which is the foundation of the s6 ecosystem. While this package is named <em>s6</em>,
that name is generally used to mean "the whole thing", so we will refer to it
as <em>s6-supervision</em> when the context makes it necessary. The goal of a
process supervision suite is to give administrators an environment to start and
control daemons in a reliable and flexible way. </li>
 <li> The <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/">s6-rc service manager</a>,
which is a management framework built on top of s6-supervision.  The goal of a
service manager is to start and stop services on a system while managing
dependencies between those services. </li>
 <li> The <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init">s6-linux-init init package</a>,
which is an add-on to s6-supervision, making it usable as an init system for
Linux in addition to a process supervisor. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The separation in different packages is purposeful: the goal is to keep the
system entirely modular and not tie it to a particular use. s6-supervision
is often used on its own, in environments that already have an init system
(no need for s6-linux-init) and a service manager (no need for s6-rc).
For the same purpose of modularity, s6 follows an approach of "one functionality,
one tool", sometimes to the extreme: the s6-supervision package, as of
2.14.0.0, hosts 75 binaries.
</p>

<p>
 This approach is successful in that it provides comprehensive functionality
with maximum efficiency: despite its growth, s6 remains extremely
<em>lightweight</em> in run-time resource usage. However, a recurring
pattern is that potential users are often rebuked by s6's apparent complexity.
</p>

<p>
 s6-frontend is an attempt at managing users' interface expectations. It
provides <em>one</em> user-facing command, named <strong>s6</strong>, that
takes intuitively-named subcommands in order to control all the important
parts of an s6-based system.
