<h1> The <tt>s6 process</tt> command </h1>

<p>
 <tt>s6 process</tt> groups actions that target services that are managed
by an instance of <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>
running on the <a href="s6-frontend.conf.html">configured</a> <em>scandir</em>.
All commands (other than help) require the services in <em>servicenames...</em>
to be a valid reference to a <a
href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html">service directory</a> with an
instance of <a
href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a> supervising it.
</p>

<h2 id="interface"> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6 process <em>subcommand</em> [ <em>subcommand_options...</em> ] [ <em>args...</em> ]
</pre>

<h2 id="subcommands"> Subcommands </h2>

<h3 id="help"> help </h3>

<p>
 <tt>s6 process help</tt> prints a short help message summarizing the options
and usage of the <tt>s6 process</tt> command. It is not as detailed as this page.
</p>

<h3 id="kill"> kill </h3>

<h4> Interface </h4>

<pre>
     s6 process kill [ -W | -w ] [ -s <em>sig</em> ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] <em>servicenames...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>s6 process kill <em>servicenames...</em></tt> sends a signal to every
supervised daemon listed by name in <em>servicenames</em>. </li>

 <li> Note that if the daemon dies as a consequence of receiving the signal,
it will normally be restarted by its supervisor. To kill a daemon and keep it
from restarting you need to use <a href="#stop"><tt>s6 process stop</tt></a>. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Options </h4>

<dl>
<dt> -W, --no-wait </dt>
<dd> Exit immediately, do not wait until the daemon has died and the service
has cleaned up. This is the default. </dd>

<dt> -w, --wait </dt>
<dd> Only exit when the daemon has died and the finish script of the service,
if any, has run. </dd>

<dt> -s <em>sig</em>, --signal=<em>sig</em> </dt>
<dd> Send signal <em>sig</em>. The default is SIGTERM. </dd>

<dt> -t <em>timeout</em>, --timeout=<em>timeout</em> </dt>
<dd> Only wait for at most <em>timeout</em> milliseconds; if the daemon still
hasn't died after that time, exit. The default is 0, meaning infinite: the
command can wait forever. This option is only effective when paired with the
<tt>--wait</tt> option. </dd>
</dl>


<h3 id="status"> status </h3>

<h4> Interface </h4>

<pre>
     s6 process status [ -L | -l ] <em>servicenames...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>s6 process status <em>servicenames...</em></tt> prints a line of
status for every
supervised daemon listed by name in <em>servicenames</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Options </h4>

<dl>
<dt> -L, --without-logs </dt>
<dd> Only print the status for <tt>/run/service/foobar</tt> even if
<tt>/run/service/foobar/log</tt> exists. This is the default. </dd>

<dt> -l, --with-logs </dt>
<dd> If a <tt>/run/service/foobar/log</tt> service directory exists,
also print its status along with the one for <tt>/run/service/foobar</tt>.
Note that this option has <em>no effect</em> on loggers managed by
s6-rc, e.g. services defined in the store and managed by
<a href="s6_live.html"><tt>s6 live</tt></a>, because these loggers are
treated at separate, independent services. The <tt>-l</tt> option is
only useful with old-style logged s6 services that are not managed by
s6-rc. </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="start"> start </h3>

<h4> Interface </h4>

<pre>
     s6 process start [ -P | -p ] [ -W | -w ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] <em>servicenames...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>s6 process start <em>servicenames...</em></tt> brings up every
supervised daemon listed by name in <em>servicenames</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Options </h4>

<dl>
<dt> -P, --no-permanent </dt>
<dd> Only change the current state of the service, not its default state.
If there is a <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html">down file</a>
in <tt>/run/service/foobar</tt>, then <tt>s6 process start foobar</tt> will
bring the service up, but it will not be restarted if <tt>foobard</tt> dies. This
is the default. </dd>

<dt> -p, --permanent </dt>
<dd> Change the current and default states of the service.
If there is a <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html">down file</a>
in <tt>/run/service/foobar</tt>, then <tt>s6 process start foobar</tt> will
delete it, and the service will be automatically be restarted
if <tt>foobard</tt> dies. </dd>

<dt> -W, --no-wait </dt>
<dd> Exit immediately, do not wait until the service is up.
This is the default. </dd>

<dt> -w, --wait </dt>
<dd> Only exit when the service is up and (if applicable) ready. </dd>

<dt> -t <em>timeout</em>, --timeout=<em>timeout</em> </dt>
<dd> Only wait for at most <em>timeout</em> milliseconds; if the daemon still
isn't up and ready after that time, exit. The default is 0, meaning infinite: the
command can wait forever. This option is only effective when paired with the
<tt>--wait</tt> option. </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="stop"> stop </h3>

<h4> Interface </h4>

<pre>
     s6 process stop [ -P | -p ] [ -W | -w ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] <em>servicenames...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>s6 process stop <em>servicenames...</em></tt> brings down every
supervised daemon listed by name in <em>servicenames</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Options </h4>

<dl>
<dt> -P, --no-permanent </dt>
<dd> Only change the current state of the service, not its default state.
If there is no <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html">down file</a>
in <tt>/run/service/foobar</tt>, then <tt>s6 process stop foobar</tt> will
stop the service, but it will still be started whenever its supervisor is started.
This is the default. </dd>

<dt> -p, --permanent </dt>
<dd> Change the current and default states of the service.
If there is no <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html">down file</a>
in <tt>/run/service/foobar</tt>, then <tt>s6 process stop foobar</tt> will
create one, and the service will not be automatically started whenever its
supervisor is started. </dd>

<dt> -W, --no-wait </dt>
<dd> Exit immediately, do not wait until the service is down.
This is the default. </dd>

<dt> -w, --wait </dt>
<dd> Only exit when the service is down and any cleanups are done. </dd>

<dt> -t <em>timeout</em>, --timeout=<em>timeout</em> </dt>
<dd> Only wait for at most <em>timeout</em> milliseconds; if the finish script
still isn't done after that time, exit. The default is 0, meaning infinite: the

</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>s6 process restart <em>servicenames...</em></tt> restarts every
supervised daemon listed by name in <em>servicenames</em>. This is achieved by
issuing a stop followed by a start command on the targeted service(s). </li>
</ul>

<h4> Options </h4>

<dl>
<dt> -W, --no-wait </dt>
<dd> Exit immediately, do not wait until the service has restarted
This is the default. </dd>

<dt> -w, --wait </dt>
<dd> Only exit when the new instance of the service is up and (if applicable) ready. </dd>

<dt> -t <em>timeout</em>, --timeout=<em>timeout</em> </dt>
<dd> Only wait for at most <em>timeout</em> milliseconds; if the service still
hasn't restarted after that time, exit. The default is 0, meaning infinite: the
command can wait forever. This option is only effective when paired with the
<tt>--wait</tt> option. </dd>
