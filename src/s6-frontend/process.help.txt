  kill		send a signal to a supervised process
  status	read the status of a supervised process


s6 process start and s6 process stop options:

  -P		--no-permanent		don't override the official state if the daemon dies
					(i.e. if the service manager says the service should be
					down, do not restart the daemon; if it says the service
					should be up, do restart it). This is the default.
  -p		--permanent		override the official state: "s6 process start foo" will
					keep foo up even if the live status says otherwise
  -W		--no-wait		exit without waiting for service readiness
  -w		--wait			only exit once the daemon is ready or confirmed dead
  -t TIMEOUT	--timeout=TIMEOUT	if -w: give up if not ready after TIMEOUT milliseconds


s6 process restart options:

  -W		--no-wait		exit without waiting for service readiness
  -w		--wait			only exit once the daemon is ready again
  -t TIMEOUT	--timeout=TIMEOUT	if -w: give up if not ready after TIMEOUT milliseconds


s6 process kill options:

  -W		--no-wait		exit without waiting for service readiness
  -w		--wait			only exit once the daemon is ready again, if applicable
  -t TIMEOUT	--timeout=TIMEOUT	if -w: give up if not ready after TIMEOUT milliseconds
